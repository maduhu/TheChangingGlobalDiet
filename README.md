"# TheChangingGlobalDiet" 

CIAT was interested in making existing research accessible to a wider audience. To that end I built multiple interactive dashboards in Tableau and helped design a website to summarize the research. In the process I cleaned raw source data, built a database of global crop consumption, performed data transformations, and conducted statistical analyses.
